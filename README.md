# Admin Dashboard
### About the project
Admin Dashboard is one of many exercises completed during completing The Odin Project web development course.  
This mock admin dashboard was built as a way to showcase the CSS grid knowledge that has been taught so far in this course.
I used Sophos security admin dashboard as a template.
